What in hells bells happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    I think possibly a hidden folder is created.  Thats where the commits are saved.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

     It's a place where you can put your files for organizational purposes.
